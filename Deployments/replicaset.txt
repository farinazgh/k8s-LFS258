In this lab:
 1. we will first explore the API objects used to manage groups of containers. The objects available have changed as Kubernetes has matured, so
the Kubernetes version in use will determine which are available.
 2. Our first object will be a ReplicaSet, which does not include newer management features found with Deployments.
 3. A Deployment operator manages ReplicaSet operators for you.
 4. We will also work with another object and watch loop called a DaemonSet which ensures a container is running on newly added node.
 5. Then we will update the software in a container, view the revision history, and roll-back to a previous version.
