There are two methods you mentioned are valid for taking a snapshot of the etcd database in Kubernetes:

1. Running `etcdctl` command from within the etcd pod/container: This approach involves accessing the etcd pod in the `kube-system` namespace and running the `etcdctl` command directly inside it. This method requires SSH-ing into the pod, setting up the necessary environment variables, and executing the etcdctl command to create a snapshot of the etcd database.
   `kubectl -n kube-system exec -it etcd-ip-172-31-40-74 -- sh -c "ETCDCTL_API=3 ETCDCTL_CACERT=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/ca.crt ETCDCTL_CERT=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.crt ETCDCTL_KEY=/etc/kubernetes/pki/etcd/server.key etcdctl --endpoints=https://127.0.0.1:2379 snapshot save /var/lib/etcd/snapshot.db "`

2. Running `etcdctl` command from a control plane node: In this approach, you directly run the etcdctl command from one of the control plane nodes of your Kubernetes cluster. You don't need to SSH into any pods. Instead, you set up the necessary environment variables on the node itself (usually in a shell or a script), and then execute the etcdctl command to create the snapshot.

Both methods achieve the same result - creating a snapshot of the etcd database. The choice between them depends on your preference, security policies, and the specific requirements of your environment.

The first method (running etcdctl inside the pod) might be preferred in environments where direct access to the pods is allowed, or if you want to automate the snapshot process within Kubernetes.

The second method (running etcdctl from a control plane node) might be preferred in environments where SSH access to pods is restricted or if you prefer to manage snapshots from outside Kubernetes.

Both methods have their advantages and drawbacks. It's important to choose the one that aligns best with your operational practices and security policies.
